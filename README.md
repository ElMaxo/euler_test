To start your INN check service:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Add proper database credentials to `config/dev.exs`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser and perform INN checks.
